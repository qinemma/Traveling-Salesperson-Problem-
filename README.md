# Traveling-Salesperson-Problem-
This program explores some approximate solutions to a well known problem in computer science called traveling salesperson problem (TSP). The idea behind this problem is as follows: you are given n points on a map (so each point has an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate) and you want to find a route to visit all of the points on the map (and arrive back where you started) while keeping the total distance travelled as small as possible.
